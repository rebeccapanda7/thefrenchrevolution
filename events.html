                <h6>King</h6>
                    <p>Louis XVI was king of France during this time. Although it was during the time of
                        absolute monarchs, Louis XVI was easily manipulated by the noble judges of parement 
                        in Paris. The nobles and clergy asserted their power over the king and weakened 
                        the monarch. 
                    </p>
                <h6>First Estate</h6> 
                    <p>Clergy- church officials</p>
                <h6>Second Estate</h6>
                    <p>Nobility- land owners</p>
                <h6>Third Estate</h6>
                    <p>Everyone Else- peasants, merchants, commoners, etc.</p>

            
                <h4>Causes</h4>
                <p>
                    The first and second estate consisted of around 3% of the population, 
                    with only the clergy and nobility. However, the third estate consisted of the rest
                    of the population: peasants, lower class, merchants, etc.
                    <br />
                    Prior to King Louis XVI's reign in France. Former King Louis XIV put France into an economic
                    crisis. Louis XIV fought endless wars to assert dominance and to gain territory for France. 
                    However, those wars were expensive and threw France into a lot of debt. Taxes were then 
                    implemented for majority of the citizens of France, excluding the clergy and nobility, meaning
                    that they were exempt from the economic burden, which was then placed on the already struggling
                    commoners. 
                    <br />
                    Louis XVI called an Estates-General meeting to get approval for raising taxes because 
                    the French Parlement shut him down.
                    Each estate only had one vote, meaning three votes in total with majority winning.
                    However, because the clergy and nobility had similar interests because they were a
                    part of the upper class, both the first and second estate voted against the third estate.
                    Because of this, the third estate never got fair representation. The people of France 
                    wanted an equal seat at the table of power. 
                    <br />
                    There were bread shortages throughout the country, and 97% of the population were going hungry.
                    They brought this problem up to the first and second estate. However, the clergy and nobility
                    had made no action to help the rest of the population because it did not affect them.

                <h3>Storming of the Bastille</h3>
                <p>This was the first real act of the revolution.
                    Louis XVI was secretly assembling troops to crush the National Assembly. However, this plot
                    was discovered, and a rebel group call the San-Culottes stormed the Bastille. Members of 
                    the National Assembly as well as many other commoner citizens stormed the 
                    Bastille. The Bastille was a armory and a prison with prisoners who were against Louis XVI. 
                    They freed all the prisoners and stole weapons and armor. They needed protection from 
                    the soldiers. They also took the warden hostage, who was then later killed in the aftermath.
                    They people cut off the heads of the soldiers and put them on pitchforks as a sign not to
                    mess with them as they walked through Paris. King Louis XVI got really concerned about the 
                    riots and political opposition. </p>
